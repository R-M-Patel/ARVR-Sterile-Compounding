##__Sterile Compounding Procedure__
* See videos `SterileCompoundAssessment_Part1.mp4` and `SterileCompoundAssessment_Part2.mp4` to see
	assessment administered by Dr. James Pschirer at the Pitt School of Pharmacy.
* Procedure should be performed six (6) inches in from the front of the hood.
* Dr. Lorin Grieve's method to remove small bubbles from syringe:
	1. Draw sterile air into syringe.
	2. Move syringe around and tap to combine small bubbles and form larger bubble.
	3. Tap out large bubble.
		
##__Common Errors Made During Assessment (according to faculty)__
* Blocking sterile airflow with hands and fingers.
* Not keeping tip of needle in liquid when drawing from vial (avoid drawing air into syringe).
* Not leaning six inches into hood to maintain a sterile environment.
* Failing to ensure that syringe kept aseptic with airflow from hood (holding syringe at correct angle).
	
##__Suggestions For AR/VR Training Game (made by faculty)__
* Record a timestamp at incorrect/failed step of assessment, play video of correct way to perform step at the end of the assessment.
* Noise (ie. ding/beep) for feedback at steps throughout assessment; text message optional (may be distraction for some students).
* Have two modes for game: 
	1. Training Mode to get used to the environment, game, procedures, etc.
	2. Assessment Mode in which rules of assessment are active and performance is monitored.
